# go-policy-template

This is a template repository you can use to scaffold a Kubewarden policy written using Go language.

Don't forget to check Kubewarden's
[official documentation](https://docs.kubewarden.io)
for more information about writing policies.

## Introduction

This repository has a working policy written in Go.

The policy looks at the `name` of a Kubernetes Pod and rejects the request if the name is on a "deny list".

The "deny list" is configurable by the user via the runtime settings of the policy.
You express the configuration of the policy using this structure:

```json
{
  "denied_names": [ "badname1", "badname2" ]
}
```

## Code organization

The code that takes care of parsing the settings is in the `settings.go` file.
Actual validation code is in the `validate.go` file.
The `main.go` only has the code to registers the entry points of the policy.

## Implementation details

> **DISCLAIMER:** WebAssembly is a constantly evolving area.
> This document describes the status of the Go ecosystem as of July 2023.

Currently, the official Go compiler can't produce WebAssembly binaries that can run **outside** the browser.
Because of that, you can only build Kubewarden Go policies with the [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/) compiler.

Kubewarden policies need to process JSON data.
For example, the policy settings and the actual request received by Kubernetes.
TinyGo doesn't yet support the full Go Standard Library,
it has limited support of Go reflection.
Because of that, it's impossible to import the official Kubernetes Go library from upstream (e.g.: `k8s.io/api/core/v1`).
Importing these official Kubernetes types results in a compilation failure.

However, it's still possible to write a Kubewarden policy by using certain third party libraries.

> **Warning:**
> Using an older version of TinyGo results in runtime errors due to the limited support for Go reflection.

This list of libraries can be useful when writing a Kubewarden policy:

- [Kubernetes Go types](https://github.com/kubewarden/k8s-objects) for TinyGo:
the official Kubernetes Go Types can't be used with TinyGo.
This module provides all the Kubernetes Types in a TinyGo-friendly way.
- Parsing JSON: Queries against JSON documents can be written using the
[gjson](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson) library.
The library features a powerful query language that allows quick navigation of JSON documents and data retrieval.
- Generic `set` implementation: Using [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)) data types can reduce the amount of code in a policy,
see the `union`, `intersection`, `difference`, and other operations provided by a Set implementation.
The [mapset](https://github.com/deckarep/golang-set) can be used when writing policies.

Last, but not least, this policy takes advantage of helper functions provided by
[Kubewarden's Go SDK](https://github.com/kubewarden/policy-sdk-go).

## Testing

This policy comes with unit tests implemented using the Go testing
framework.

As usual, the tests are defined in `_test.go` files.
As these tests aren't part of the final WebAssembly binary, the official Go compiler can be used to run them.

The unit tests can be run via a simple command:

```console
make test
```

It's also important to test the final result of the TinyGo compilation:
the actual WebAssembly module.

This is done with a second set of end-to-end tests.
These tests use the `kwctl` cli provided by the Kubewarden project to load and execute the policy.

The e2e tests are implemented using
[bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core),
the Bash Automated Testing System.

The end-to-end tests are defined in the `e2e.bats` file and can be run using:

```console
make e2e-tests
```

## Automation

This project has the following [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions):

- `e2e-tests`: this action builds the WebAssembly policy,
installs the `bats` utility and then runs the end-to-end test.
- `unit-tests`: this action runs the Go unit tests.
- `release`: this action builds the WebAssembly policy and pushes it to a user defined OCI registry
([ghcr](https://ghcr.io) is a good candidate).
